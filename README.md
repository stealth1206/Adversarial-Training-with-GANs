# Adversarial-Training-with-GANs
It was a Research project to get a in-depth knowledge of the vast field related to Adversarial Machine Learning. Following listed topics were hot topics of our Research :
1. Adversarial Attacks and Trainings
2. Sparse Adversarial Attacks
3. One-Pixel Attacks
4. Robustness and Transferability of Adversarial Attacks
5. Generative Adversarial Attacks

Also I tried some practical hands-on implementation of targeted attacks on following datasets :
1. FASHION MNIST
2. MNIST DIGIT
3. CIFAR-10

My research conclusions and reports have been shared in the attachments.
